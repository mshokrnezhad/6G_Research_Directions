This document aims to outline a comprehensive guideline for selecting a promising research subject. The document comprises five sections: **directions**, **use cases**, **objectives**, **constraints**, and **approaches**. 

**Directions** discuss possible research trends for systems that go beyond the capabilities of 5G. Each direction is meticulously outlined by:
1. Highlighting potential **use cases** 
2. Addressing challenging problems within it by specifying clear **objectives** and **constraints** relevant to the subject matter.

Subsequently, all conceivable **use cases** introducing promising futuristic services, **objectives** delineating potential goals for addressing associated problems and subproblems, and **constraints** identifying limitations requiring consideration in problem-solving, are elaborated upon. Finally, various **approaches** are introduced to tackle these directions, incorporating promising techniques to effectively address the outlined **objectives** and **constraints**.

Irrespective of the specified directions, any combination $⟨u, o, c⟩$ where $u \in$ **use cases**, $o \in$ **objectives**, and $c \in$ **constraints** defines a research endeavor that can be addressed using the methods described in **approaches** by researchers (postdocs, Ph.D. candidates, or master's students, depending on the complexity of the combination) to yield scientific outcomes. It is indisputable that advanced scenarios can be generated by merging **directions**, and complex problems can be developed by taking into account joint **objectives** and multiple **constraints**.

Using this guideline, researchers can effectively identify and evaluate potential research subjects that align with their interests, expertise, and the broader objectives of their research endeavors.
